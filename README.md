# GEHelveHammer
This mod patches the Helve Hammer to allow it to process an extended array of 2D vanilla smithing recipes.
Hammers and Helve Hammers still require manual smithing or casting.

Extended recipies have a 75% helve hammer smithing speed penalty as a temporary balance measure indicated by 'slag' particles. Plate and Ironbloom are unchanged.
