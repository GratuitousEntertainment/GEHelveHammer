# GEHelveHammer
This mod patches the Helve Hammer to allow it to process an extended array of 2D vanilla smithing recipes.
Hammers, Helve Hammers, and Padlocks still require manual smithing or casting.

Extended recipies have a 75% helve hammer smithing speed penalty as a temporary balance measure indicated by 'slag' particles. Plate and Ironbloom are unchanged.



Future releases will allow tweaking of the penalty and 'accepted recipes' list via Json.

**Please backup your world before adding. Other mods which alter the anvil, smithing, or helve hammer may cause problems as the vanilla anvil behavior has been updated by this mod.**
